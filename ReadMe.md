# Tinyx86, a tiny x86 realmode emulator with BIOS interaction.

1. First, i love programming and i do it in my own style and this project is also for me to learn
more about x86 Realmode (Bare Metal) and the assembly language and how the BIOS interrupts work.
More about me [here](https://github.com/Littleclone/Myself).
2. Second, i have my own style to code what works really good for me, but its maybe harder for others to read
so i set some rules you can read to make it easier for you to read my code, i will also comment more things.[rules](https://github.com/Littleclone/Tinyx86/blob/master/docs/rules.md)

Please remember that i am Learning and do things my way, you are free to point out bugs and errors, but please
remember, i write in my own style because its works better for me. More you find [here](https://github.com/Littleclone/Myself).
